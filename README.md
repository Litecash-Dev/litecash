# Features (ie. Things that make Litecash special)

* No premine.  No ICO.  No Founders Rewards.  No developer rewards.
* Initial block reward 275, halving after 1 year from start of mainnet, and halving thereafter every 4 years (ala BTC)
* Users have complete control over privacy - users have complete control over their personal data in accordance to their will and applicable laws.
* Confidentiality without penalty - confidential transactions do not cause bloating of the blockchain, avoiding excessive computational overhead
  or penalty on performance or scalability while completely concealing the transaction value.
* No trusted setup required
* Blocks are mined using Equihash Proof-of-Work algorithm.
* Limited emission using periodic halving.
* No addresses are stored in the blockchain - no information whatsoever about either the sender or the receiver of a transaction is stored in the blockchain.
* Superior scalability through compact blockchain size - using the “cut-through” feature of Mimblewimble makes the Litecash blockchain orders of magnitude
  smaller than any other blockchain implementation.
